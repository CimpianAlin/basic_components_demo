# REDHAWK Basic Waveforms - Basic Components Demo Waveform
 
## Description

Contains the source and build script for the REDHAWK Basic Components Demo Waveform. This waveform is an example using a few core assets. Data from a siggen is created and manipulated just to demonstrate REDHAWK.

## Build/Installation Instructions
This is a wavform project and thus does not need to be built just installed into the SDRROOT/dom/waveforms directory. One way to do that is to open the project in the REDHAWK IDE and drag it into the Target SDR Folder.
